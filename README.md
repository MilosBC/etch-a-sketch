# etch-a-sketch

A Javascript version of a sketchpad. 

Just hover over the board with your mouse pointer to change the color of each individual square. You can use the default black color to create your sketch or you can rely on random colors to generate a new (random) color for each individual square. You can also use the eraser to eliminate the sketch effect on each square separately or the "clear the grid" option to "reset the board" entirely.

Moreover, you can increase or decrease the grid size by creating a new grid. Use values between 1 and 100 to create a new grid. For example, if you enter 50, you will get 50 squares on each side of the grid (50 x 50) instead of 16 by default (16 x 16). The same applies to other values in the given interval.

Last but not least - you can easily toggle the border on and off by clicking the "show/hide border" button.
